# ES Circuits

## About

    This is just a small incomplete side project of mine. It is supposed to be in implementation of various DC circuit calculations in the C programming language. Probably a bit ambitious, but it's more about the process, right?

## Plans
-   Finish circuit ADT implementations
-   Eventually add basic circuit analysis
    -   Ohm's law
    -   Nodal Analysis
        -   Matric calculations
-   GUI, maybe? Idk, C isn't the best language for that
